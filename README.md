# my_tools
Tools I crafted.

#zip_ver_1.00 is a tool to zip multiple files at once.
All you have to do is copy this python script to your desired Path(folder).
Run the scrpit and it will create the zipped version of all files where the script is copy pasted.

#hasher is a tool to generate the HASH value of the files.
Just copy the the script and paste to your desired path.
It will genereate the hash code of all files in a newly generated foler named (result_file) which inculde file name : hash code format.
